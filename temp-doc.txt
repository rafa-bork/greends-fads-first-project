Questions / Tasks

Open the file temp-doc.txt that is inside the folder greends-fads-first-project, with VS Code, or your text editor, and copy and answer the following questions:

5.1. Can you explain the copy (cp ../temp-* .) command used above?

	The command copies ("cp") all files in the parent directory ("../") whose name begins with "temp-" ("temp-*") to the current directory (".")		
5.2. Can you explain why, in this case, we did not have to do git init?

	Since the directory was cloned from github, there was no need to initialize the git versioning with the "git init" command, since it was already active.

5.3. Can you commit the files copied? What do you need to do? Execute the commands that are needed.

	Yes, Firstly we need to stage the files with "$ git add temp-*" and then execute the command "$ git commit -m "first commit"" to commit the files copied

Don't forget to save the file.
